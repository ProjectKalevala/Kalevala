						<h3>Community News:
						We are excited to announce the latest developments in our community project. Our team is currently programming a decentralized exchange and will soon begin testing the Layer-1 Network. Our goal is to create a fast, scalable, and low-cost blockchain platform that utilizes our own Quantum Secure Virtual Machine (QSVM). We are integrating Kalevala Mainnet with Quantum Secure Encryption and DeCentralized Peer-to-Peer Network Capabilities to ensure the highest level of security.
Our project is part of a growing ecosystem of blockchain networks that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible. We are proud to be part of this community of innovators and look forward to sharing more updates as our project progresses.

							<h6> Kalevala.org is the world's first quantum secure layer-1 network and decentralized exchange that supports quantum secure encryption and artificial intelligence. The platform utilizes quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum Cryptography to secure the blockchain and enable two parties to exchange secure data while detecting and defending against third parties. This futuristic convergence of IoT and quantum computing introduces avant-garde Encryption algorithms for resilient security solutions in IoT systems. The platform is designed to be quantum-safe, protecting secrets from the attacks of far-future quantum computers. A team of blockchain and quantum cryptological Specialists is developing a framework to create quantum-safe blockchains, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology has Revealed four Finalists in its search for a post-quantum Cryptography standard, three of which use Lattice cryptography, a scheme inspired by lattices, regular arrangements of dots in space. Kalevala.org is at the forefront of this cutting-edge technology, offering a secure and innovative platform for decentralized exchange and quantum secure encryption.

____________

How does Kalevala.org use quantum key distribution to secure its network
___________
word-wrap: break-word

Kalevala.org uses quantum key distribution (QKD) to secure its network. QKD is a secure communication method that uses quantum mechanics to enable two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. QKD uses properties found in quantum physics to exchange cryptographic keys in such a way that it is provable and guarantees security. It is based on physical properties and is entirely quantum, unlike quantum-resistant cryptography, which is typically less expensive with a better understood risk profile. QKD requires special-purpose equipment and is based on physical properties, making it more reliable and less expensive than a secure human courier network. By using QKD, Kalevala.org ensures that its network is secure and resistant to attacks from quantum computers.

What are the advantages of using quantum key distribution over traditional encryption methods

_________


Quantum key distribution (QKD) has several advantages over traditional encryption methods. QKD uses properties found in quantum physics to exchange cryptographic keys in such a way that it is provable and guarantees security. It enables two parties to produce a shared random secret key known only to them, which can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. QKD is entirely quantum, unlike traditional encryption methods that use classical algorithms. QKD systems also have the advantage of being automatic, with greater reliability and lower operating costs than a secure human courier network. Moreover, the confidentiality services QKD offers can be provided by quantum-resistant cryptography, which is typically less expensive with a better understood risk profile. Key distribution on a conventional scale relies on public key ciphers that use complicated mathematical calculations requiring a prohibitive amount of processing power to break. The viability of public key ciphers, however, faces several issues, such as the constant implementation of new strategies. As the use of quantum computers becomes more frequent, the possibility that an attacker could use quantum computing to crack into current encryption methods increases. QKD provides a quantum-safe key exchange, based on very different principles, that could provide the long-term confidentiality required by many applications.

What is the role of artificial intelligence in Kalevala.org's network and decentralized exchange
__________
								word-wrap: break-word
Kalevala.org's network and decentralized exchange utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance their functionality.  AI can be used in various ways in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. One platform, for example, uses AI to make the trading of crypto more accessible and straightforward
  AI leverages computers, data, and sometimes machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind
  Decentralized AI can function locally on users' devices, have access to more user data, and have no dependence on a network
  The combination of blockchain and AI can produce Intelligent automated decision-making systems that provide highly reliable outputs that trigger specific real-world outcomes based on immutable, tamper-proof data
  Therefore, it is possible that Kalevala.org's AI is used to enhance the security and reliability of its network and decentralized exchange.</h6>
